@article{Dahlqvist:2020,
	abstract = {Context. Beyond the choice of wavefront control systems or coronographs, advanced data processing methods play a crucial role in disentangling potential planetary signals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among these methods, angular differential imaging (ADI) for data sets obtained in pupil tracking mode (ADI sequences) is one of the foremost research avenues, considering the many observing programs performed with ADI-based techniques and the associated discoveries. <BR /> Aims: Inspired by the field of econometrics, here we propose a new detection algorithm for ADI sequences, deriving from the regime-switching model first proposed in the 1980s. <BR /> Methods: The proposed model is very versatile as it allows the use of PSF-subtracted data sets (residual cubes) provided by various ADI-based techniques, separately or together, to provide a single detection map. The temporal structure of the residual cubes is used for the detection as the model is fed with a concatenated series of pixel-wise time sequences. The algorithm provides a detection probability map by considering two possible regimes for concentric annuli, the first one accounting for the residual noise and the second one for the planetary signal in addition to the residual noise. <BR /> Results: The algorithm performance is tested on data sets from two instruments, VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE. The results show an overall better performance in the receiver operating characteristic space when compared with standard signal-to-noise-ratio maps for several state-of-the-art ADI-based post-processing algorithms.},

@article{GomezGonzalez:2018,
	abstract = {Context. Post-processing algorithms play a key role in pushing the detection limits of high-contrast imaging (HCI) instruments. State-of-the-art image processing approaches for HCI enable the production of science-ready images relying on unsupervised learning techniques, such as low-rank approximations, for generating a model point spread function (PSF) and subtracting the residual starlight and speckle noise. <BR /> Aims: In order to maximize the detection rate of HCI instruments and survey campaigns, advanced algorithms with higher sensitivities to faint companions are needed, especially for the speckle-dominated innermost region of the images. <BR /> Methods: We propose a reformulation of the exoplanet detection task (for ADI sequences) that builds on well-established machine learning techniques to take HCI post-processing from an unsupervised to a supervised learning context. In this new framework, we present algorithmic solutions using two different discriminative models: SODIRF (random forests) and SODINN (neural networks). We test these algorithms on real ADI datasets from VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE HCI instruments. We then assess their performances by injecting fake companions and using receiver operating characteristic analysis. This is done in comparison with state-of-the-art ADI algorithms, such as ADI principal component analysis (ADI-PCA). <BR /> Results: This study shows the improved sensitivity versus specificity trade-off of the proposed supervised detection approach. At the diffraction limit, SODINN improves the true positive rate by a factor ranging from 2 to 10 (depending on the dataset and angular separation) with respect to ADI-PCA when working at the same false-positive level. <BR /> Conclusions: The proposed supervised detection framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in the task of discriminating planet signal from speckles. In addition, it offers the possibility of re-processing existing HCI databases to maximize their scientific return and potentially improve the demographics of directly imaged exoplanets.},

@article{Rainot:2020,
	abstract = {Context. Massive stars like company. However, low-mass companions have remained extremely difficult to detect at angular separations (ρ) smaller than 1″ (approx. 1000-3000 au, considering the typical distance to nearby massive stars) given the large brightness contrast between the companion and the central star. Constraints on the low-mass end of the companions mass-function for massive stars are needed, however, for helping, for example, to distinguish among the various scenarios that describe the formation of massive stars. <BR /> Aims: With the aim of obtaining a statistically significant constraint on the presence of low-mass companions beyond the typical detection limit of current surveys (Δmag ≲ 5 at ρ ≲ 1″), we initiated a survey of O and Wolf-Rayet stars in the Carina region using the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) coronagraphic instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In this, the first paper of the series, we aim to introduce the survey, to present the methodology and to demonstrate the capability of SPHERE for massive stars using the multiple system QZ Car. <BR /> Methods: We obtained VLT-SPHERE snapshot observations in the IRDIFS_EXT mode, which combines the IFS and IRDIS sub-systems and simultaneously provides us four-dimensional (4D) data cubes in two different fields-of-view: 1.73″ × 1.73″ for IFS (39 spectral channels across the YJH bands) and 12″ × 12″ for IRDIS (two spectral channels across the K band). Angular- and spectral-differential imaging techniques as well as PSF-fitting were applied to detect and measure the relative flux of the companions in each spectral channel. The latter were then flux-calibrated using theoretical SED models of the central object and compared to a grid of ATLAS9 atmosphere model and (pre-)main-sequence evolutionary tracks, providing a first estimate of the physical properties of the detected companions. <BR /> Results: Detection limits of 9 mag at ρ &gt; 200 mas for IFS, and as faint as 13 mag at ρ &gt; 1.″8 for IRDIS (corresponding to sub-solar masses for potential companions), can be reached in snapshot observations of only a few minutes integration times, allowing us to detect 19 sources around the QZ Car system. All but two are reported here for the first time. With near-IR magnitude contrasts in the range of 4 to 7.5 mag, the three brightest sources (Ab, Ad, and E) are most likely to be physically bound. They have masses in the range of 2 to 12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and are potentially co-eval with QZ Car central system. The remaining sources have flux contrast of 1.5 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> to 9.5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> (ΔK ≈ 11 to 13 mag). Their presence can be explained by the local source density and they are, thus, likely to be chance alignments. If they were members of the Carina nebula, they would be sub-solar-mass pre-main sequence stars. <BR /> Conclusions: Based on this proof of concept, we show that the VLT/SPHERE allows us to reach the sub-solar mass regime of the companion mass function. It paves the way for this type of observation with a large sample of massive stars to provide novel constraints on the multiplicity of massive stars in a region of the parameter space that has remained inaccessible so far.},

@article{Rainot:2022,
	abstract = {Context. Most massive stars belong to multiple systems, yet the formation process leading to such high multiplicity remains insufficiently understood. To help constrain the different formation scenarios that exist, insights into the low-mass end of the companion mass function of such stars is crucial. However, this is a challenging endeavour as (sub-)solar mass companions at angular separations (ρ) below 1″ (corresponding to 1000-3000 au in nearby young open clusters and OB associations) are difficult to detect due to the large brightness contrast with the central star. <BR /> Aims: With the Carina High-contrast Imaging Project of massive Stars (CHIPS), we aim to obtain statistically significant constraints on the presence and properties of low-mass companions around massive stars in a previously unreachable observing window (Δmag ≳ 10 at ρ ≲ 1″). In the second paper of the series, we focus on the Trumpler 14 cluster, which harbours some of the youngest and most massive O-type stars in the Milky Way. <BR /> Methods: We obtained VLT-SPHERE observations of seven O-type objects in Trumpler 14 using IRDIFS_EXT mode. These provide us with a 12″ × 12″ field of view (approximately ((3 × 3)×10<SUP>4</SUP> au) centred on each O star and allow us to search for companions at separations larger than 0″.15 (approx. 360 au) and down to magnitude contrast &gt; 10 mag in the near-infrared. We used angular and spectral differential imaging along with Point Spread Function (PSF) fitting to detect sources and measure their flux relative to that of the central object. We then used grids of ATLAS9 and PHOENIX Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) atmosphere models combined with (pre-)main-sequence evolutionary tracks to estimate the mass of the detected candidate companions. <BR /> Results: We detected 211 sources with near-infrared magnitude contrast in the range of 2-12. Given the large surface number density of stars in Trumpler 14, one cannot reliably distinguish between cluster members and genuine companions for most of the detected sources. The closest companion, at only 0″.26, is characterised as a 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> star with an age of 0.6 Myr, in excellent agreement with previous age estimates for Tr 14. The mass function peaks at about 0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and presents a dearth of stars in the 0.5-0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> mass range compared to previous estimates of the initial mass function in Tr 14. While statistically significant, part of these differences may result from contamination of the K-band fluxes by circumstellar material. <BR /> Conclusions: SPHERE is clearly suitable to probe the low-mass end of the mass function in the vicinity of massive stars. Follow-up SPHERE observations to obtain the full Y to K spectral energy distribution would allow for better constraints on the masses of the detected sources, and to confirm (or invalidate) the curious mass function that we derived for low-mass stars in the vicinity of the O-type objects in Trumpler 14. <P />Table 2 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/658/A198">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/658/A198</A>},

We performed multi-epoch high-contrast imaging in the near-infrared with the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument. The companion is found at a projected separation of 244.7 $\pm$ 13.2 au and a position angle of 176.4 $\pm$ 0.1 deg. The large separation supports formation via gravitational instability. From the spectrum, we estimate a mass of 0.1─0.5 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, the range conveying uncertainties in the extinction of the companion and in evolutionary models at young ages. The orbit coincides with a gap in the dust disk inferred from the spectral energy distribution. The young age (≲1 Myr) and mass ratio with the central star (̃0.01) makes the companion comparable to PDS 70 b, suggesting a relation between formation scenarios and disk dynamics.},

@article{Hirsch:2019,
	abstract = {We report on the discovery of a white dwarf companion to the nearby late G dwarf star, HD 159062. The companion is detected in 14 years of precise radial velocity (RV) data, and in high-resolution imaging observations. RVs of HD 159062 from 2003 to 2018 reveal an acceleration of -13.3 $\pm$ 0.12   m      s   <SUP>-1</SUP>  yr  <SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating that it hosts a companion with a long-period orbit. Subsequent imaging observations with the ShaneAO system on the Lick Observatory 3 m Shane telescope, the PHARO AO system on the Palomar Observatory 5 m telescope, and the NIRC2 AO system at the Keck II 10 m telescope reveal a faint companion 2.″7 from the primary star. We performed relative photometry, finding ΔJ = 10.09 $\pm$ 0.38 mag,   Δ    K <SUB>s</SUB>=10.06+/- 0.22 mag, and   Δ   L<SUP>\prime</SUP> =9.67+/- 0.08 mag for the companion from these observations. Analysis of the radial velocities, astrometry, and photometry reveals that the combined data set can only be reconciled for the scenario where HD 159062 B is a white dwarf. A full Bayesian analysis of the RV and imaging data to obtain the cooling age, mass, and orbital parameters of the white dwarf indicates that the companion is an old  M <SUB>B</SUB>= 0.65 <SUB>-0.04</SUB><SUP>+0.12</SUP> M <SUB>⊙ </SUB> white dwarf with an orbital period of P= 250 <SUB>-76</SUB><SUP>+130</SUP> yr, and a cooling age of τ = 8.2 <SUB>-0.5</SUB><SUP>+0.3</SUP> Gyr.},

	abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

	abstract = {Transition discs are prime targets to look for protoplanets and study planet-disc interactions. We present VLT/SINFONI observations of PDS 70, a transition disc with a recently claimed embedded protoplanet. We take advantage of the angular and spectral diversity present in our data for an optimal PSF modelling and subtraction using principal component analysis (PCA). We report the redetection of PDS 70 b, both the front and far side of the outer disc edge, and the detection of several extended features in the annular gap. We compare spectral differential imaging applied before (PCA-SADI), and after (PCA-ASDI) angular differential imaging. Our tests suggest that PCA-SADI better recovers extended features, while PCA-ASDI is more sensitive to point sources. We adapted the negative fake companion (NEGFC) technique to infer the astrometry of the companion, and derived r = 193.5 $\pm$ 4.9 mas and PA =158.7<SUP>$\,^{\circ}$</SUP> $\pm$ 3.0<SUP>$\,^{\circ}$</SUP>. We used both NEGFC and ANDROMEDA to infer the K-band spectro-photometry of the protoplanet, and found results consistent with recent VLT/SPHERE observations, except for their 2018/02 epoch measurement in the K2 filter. Finally, we derived an upper limit of \dot M_b  &lt; 1.26 × 10^ -7  \big [ 5 M_Jup/M_b \big ] \big [ R_b/R_Jup\big ] M_Jup yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for the accretion rate of the companion based on an adaptation of PCA-SADI/PCA-ASDI around the Brγ line (assuming no extinction).},

@article{Cantalloube:2015,
	abstract = {Context. The direct detection of exoplanets with high-contrast imaging requires advanced data processing methods to disentangle potential planetary signals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among them, angular differential imaging (ADI) permits potential planetary signals with a known rotation rate to be separated from instrumental speckles that are either statics or slowly variable. The method presented in this paper, called ANDROMEDA for ANgular Differential OptiMal Exoplanet Detection Algorithm, is based on a maximum likelihood approach to ADI and is used to estimate the position and the flux of any point source present in the field of view.  Aims: In order to optimize and experimentally validate this previously proposed method, we applied ANDROMEDA to real VLT/NaCo data. In addition to its pure detection capability, we investigated the possibility of defining simple and efficient criteria for automatic point source extraction able to support the processing of large surveys.  Methods: To assess the performance of the method, we applied ANDROMEDA on VLT/NaCo data of TYC-8979-1683-1 which is surrounded by numerous bright stars and on which we added synthetic planets of known position and flux in the field. In order to accommodate the real data properties, it was necessary to develop additional pre-processing and post-processing steps to the initially proposed algorithm. We then investigated its skill in the challenging case of a well-known target, beta Pictoris, whose companion is close to the detection limit and we compared our results to those obtained by another method based on principal component analysis (PCA).  Results: Application on VLT/NaCo data demonstrates the ability of ANDROMEDA to automatically detect and characterize point sources present in the image field. We end up with a robust method bringing consistent results with a sensitivity similar to the recently published algorithms, with only two parameters to be fine tuned. Moreover, the companion flux estimates are not biased by the algorithm parameters and do not require a posteriori corrections.  Conclusions: ANDROMEDA is an attractive alternative to current standard image processing methods that can be readily applied to on-sky data.  Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under programme ID 184.C-0567(D) and 60.A-9800(J).},

@article{Pairet:2019,
	abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task as it requires to reach a high contrast at very close separation to the star. Today, the main limitation in the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles that are created by residual instrumental aberrations. They have the same angular size as planetary companions and are often brighter, hence hindering our capability to detect exoplanets. Dedicated observation strategies and signal processing techniques are necessary to disentangle these speckles from planetary signals. The output of these methods is a detection map in which the value of each pixel is related to a probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found in the literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is Gaussian. However, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates, especially close to the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of detection map by analysing the speckle noise distribution, namely the Modified Rician distribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum of random variables to show that the tail of the distribution of the residual noise decays as an exponential distribution, hence explaining the high false detection rate obtained with the Gaussian assumption. From this analysis, we introduce a novel time domain detection map and we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance of our approach through experiments on real data. We also provide an empirical rule to determine detection threshold providing a good trade-off between true positive and false positive rates for exoplanet detection.},

	abstract = {At present the best methods for rotation of discrete sampled images use a combination of (fast) Fourier interpolation followed by cubic interpolation onto a rotated grid. A method is presented which uses only Fourier interpolation. The new method has a similar computational complexity to the old, and is exactly reversible. The method uses the well-known decomposition of rotation into three pure shears. Each shear is performed using a 2D extension of the 1D Fourier shift theorem. This allows the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to be used. With appropriate data padding (such as zero padding) in both the real and Fourier domains, the procedure gives near perfect results and minimal loss of information in multiple rotation tests.},

@article{Christiaens:2021,
	abstract = {Understanding how giant planets form requires observational input from directly imaged protoplanets. We used VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE to search for companions in the transition disc of 2MASS J19005804-3645048 (hereafter CrA-9), an accreting M0.75 dwarf with an estimated age of 1-2 Myr. We found a faint point source at ∼0.7-arcsec separation from CrA-9 (∼108 au projected separation). Our 3-epoch astrometry rejects a fixed background star with a 5σ significance. The near-IR absolute magnitudes of the object point towards a planetary-mass companion. However, our analysis of the 1.0-3.8 $\,\mu$ m spectrum extracted for the companion suggests it is a young M5.5 dwarf, based on both the 1.13-μm Na index and comparison with templates of the Montreal Spectral Library. The observed spectrum is best reproduced with high effective temperature ( $3057^ +119 _ -36 $ K) BT-DUSTY and BT-SETTL models, but the corresponding photometric radius required to match the measured flux is only $0.60^ +0.01 _ -0.04 $ Jovian radius. We discuss possible explanations to reconcile our measurements, including an M-dwarf companion obscured by an edge-on circum-secondary disc or the shock-heated part of the photosphere of an accreting protoplanet. Follow-up observations covering a larger wavelength range and/or at finer spectral resolution are required to discriminate these two scenarios.},

@article{Soummer:2012,
	abstract = {We describe a new method to achieve point-spread function (PSF) subtractions for high-contrast imaging using principal component analysis that is applicable to both point sources or extended objects (disks). Assuming a library of reference PSFs, a Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve transform of these references is used to create an orthogonal basis of eigenimages on which the science target is projected. For detection this approach provides comparable suppression to the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) algorithm, albeit with increased robustness to the algorithm parameters and speed enhancement. For characterization of detected sources, the method enables forward modeling of astrophysical sources. This alleviates the biases in the astrometry and photometry of discovered faint sources, which are usually associated with LOCI-based PSF subtractions schemes. We illustrate the algorithm performance using archival Hubble Space Telescope images, but the approach may also be considered for ground-based data acquired with angular differential imaging or integral-field spectrographs.},
